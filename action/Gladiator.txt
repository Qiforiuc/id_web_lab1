The tale of a Roman general who is betrayed, left for dead, and then begins a slow and violent road towards vengeance as a gladiator, Ridley Scott’s movie is epic in every sense of the word. From the painstaking recreation of ancient Rome in all its magisterial and architectural glory to the breathtaking action sequences, it’s visually huge—and emotionally just as grand. Russell Crowe is magnetic as the vengeful Maximus, and Joaquin Phoenix drips menace as the sniveling Emperor. This drama movie is a breathtaking journey.

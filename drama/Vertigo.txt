Starring Jimmy Stewart as a former police detective suffering from an acute fear of heights as well as the titular sense of dizziness and disorientation, this drama movie follows Stewart’s “Scottie” Ferguson as he trails a mystery woman played by Kim Novak. This is Hitchcock at his finest— leading you along while constantly forcing you to question everything you’re seeing. Is Ferguson becoming dangerously obsessed? Is Novak’s Madeleine crazy? This classic thriller keeps you guessing and second-guessing all the way until the unforgettable ending.
